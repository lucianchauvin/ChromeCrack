Rubber ducky script to copy the chrome "Login Data" and "Login State" to the ruber ducky using the TwinDuck firmware. ChromeCrack.py takes in a folder in which holds the two files and then outputs a plain text file with the URL, username, and password for each site listed.


NOTE: This has been one of the most annoying things to code that I have ever done. 1. There is no real emulator so I have to send it to the Rubber Ducky every single time I make a small little change and THEN I have to unplug it and plug it back in. 2. At that point if things don't work I don't even know what went wrong, I have to manually run my code in the shell to see where it went wrong, then make the change, and the process repeats. Takes like 1000000000x longer than coding anything else. My next project will definitely be to make a duck program emulator to run on your computer.
